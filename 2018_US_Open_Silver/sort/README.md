## Observations
1. Notice it sorts in ascending order
2. Each for loop put the largest unsorted element to the end
3. For every number, if a smaller number appear after it, then it cost one iteration to put this number on the right place.

## Solution
Letc count how many number satisfy obseration 3, the answer = N - #counts + 1
